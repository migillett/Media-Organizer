# Media-Organizer
This simple Python 3 program walks through each file and directory of a given folder and searches for photos and videos. It then copies them to a destination and organizes them into folders based on date created.

## How To Use
Open up the `media_organize.py` and edit the variables `source_dir` and `dest_dir`. You can put as many source folders in the list as you like.

You can also use the GUI by launching `MediaOrganizer_GUI.py`.

## Dependencies
The GUI requires Tkinter. Install it using `pip3 install tkinter`.
