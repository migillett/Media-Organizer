# Media-Organizer
This simple program walks through each file and directory of a given folder and searches for photos and videos. It then copies them to a destination and organizes them into folders based on date created.

## How To Use
Open up the `media_organize.py` and edit the variables `source_dir` and `dest_dir`. You can put as many source destinations in the list as you like. That's it!
